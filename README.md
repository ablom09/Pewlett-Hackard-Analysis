# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**OVERVIEW**

Bobby and myself are determining the number of retiring employees per title as well as identifying the employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. From our analysis using SQL, we will submit our results to management who will learn about how many current employees have reached retirement age.

**RESULTS**

o	From the finding of the eligible retirees, there is a high volume of the workforce could retire at any given time.
o	32,452 Staff
o	29,415 Senior Engineer
o	14,221 Engineer
o	8,047 Senior Staff
o	4,502 Technique Leader
o	1,761 Assistant Engineer

**SUMMARY**

1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Based on the results, there are in total 90,398 roles that are potentially at risk of having their workers retiring at any moment. Because we canâ€™t predict how when this will occur, we should assume that they all will need to be filled in the near future, potentially, at any moment.
2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
No, based on our finding we only have 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, well below the 90,398 roles that are having employee turnover occur at any moment.
